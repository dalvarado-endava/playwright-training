## General information

Thank you for joining in this learning journey.

Playwright is a great alternative to what we are accustomed to, since not only it is easy enough to be a great learning experience, it is also deep enough to provide several approaches to the different scenarios we may encounter during a project. Therefore it is a great opportunity to expand our skillset and learn a reliable tool for our end-to-end testing.

## Learning Path

Playwright, as any other tool, has a learning curve which difficulty will depend on each person; however, the learning path provided below will serve as a starting point to achieve basic knowledge and start exploring what _Playwright_ has to offer.

### First steps

1. What is Playwright?
   - What languages does it support?
   - What benefits does it have over other tools? (this hopefully will help us decide whether or not _Playwright_ is a great option for our project or not)
2. How to setup a project
   - Since _Playwright_ supports different languages, choose the one you feel more comfortable with (or the one you want to learn) and start setting up your project
3. Write your first test using _Playwright_ with the _"automationpractice.com"_ website.

Great! You have successfully started using playwright. Now let's dive deeper.

## Course of action

During this training, these topics mentioned above should be covered. To do so, the proposal is:

- Form 2 teams to work together
- Each group should be working with a different language.
- During the first week, we should meet at least 4 times to discuss the topics and take a learning approach to it
- During the next 4 weeks, we should meet at least once or twice to continue with the topics while applying what has been learned to the Demo Project.
- During weeks 3, 4, and 5, we should meet on friday () to show our progress in the project, and present a Demo of what we have been working on.
- If you have any questions regarding the tools, feel free to ask and if it is necessary, we could discuss them during the meetings so we can all build knowledge as a group.

## Meeting session methodology

During each session, the methodology proposal is:

- Answering questions that may have arised while using the tool
- Presenting the topic
- Applying the new topic to test a demo website
